Gregory Kielian is a lead of a multidisciplinary team at Google Research,
bringing the power of transformers and large language models (LLMs) to
edge-hardware. His team explores hardware-software co-design of novel ML
architectures, datasets, transformer-training techniques, efficient algorithms,
as well as exploration into of the realm of EdgeLLM ASICs. By paving the way for
LLMs to efficiently operate locally on edge-devices, Kielian's team aims to
unlock a new era of possibilities and real-time interaction with
locally-intelligent machines.
