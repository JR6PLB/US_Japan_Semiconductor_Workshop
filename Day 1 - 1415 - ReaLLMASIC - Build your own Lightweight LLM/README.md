# Build Your Own Lightweight LLM

LLMs are known for large weights and large training and inference costs.

However, there are several tools and frameworks for training efficient LLMs.

In this workshop we'll go over usage of ReaLLMASIC, a repo building upon the
popular NanoGPT library and that explorations and quickstarts for  LLM applications.


## Workshop Topics

* **Hands-On Building:** Gain practical experience constructing your own lightweight LLM, from architecture design to training and deployment.
* **Hardware-First LLMs:** Dive into topics for targeting LLMs specifically optimized for on-device deployments.

## Agenda

Intro
- LLMs and applications
- Recap of LLM architecture
Hands-on AI:
- Building and training a custom lightweight LLM
- Data preparation and preprocessing
- Model training options and optimization
- Finetuning from a checkpoint

## Materials

All workshop materials, code examples, and slides will be provided through this
repository. Please clone or download the repository before the workshop.
