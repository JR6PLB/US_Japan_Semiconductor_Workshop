This presentation provides an overview of a new mixed-signal IC design course that uses uses open-source tools and an open-source process design kit (PDK). EE 628 at the University of Hawaii follows a top-down approach to introduce students to the careabouts in mixed-signal design. Students with a broad range of backgrounds team up to implement a "template" delta-sigma modulator from high-level modeling to physical layout. The resulting designs will be manufactured in IHP's SG13G2 130 nm CMOS process technology.
